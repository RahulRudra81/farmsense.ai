**farmsense.ai** is an Ai assistant for exponentially growing Hybrid farming. To enhance farmers' yield, this application assists them by detecting diseases of plants and poultries and providing crop and egg incubation analysis. CNN, YOLO, and XGBoost are used for the models.  

<h3>Features Introduced</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Plant Diseases Detection - ResNetV250 Model (Fine Tuned)</li>
  <li>Poultry Diseases Detection - MobileNetV250 Model (Fine Tuned)</li>
  <li>Egg Incubation Analysis - YOLOv8 Object Detection Model (Fine Tuned)</li>
  <li>Crop Analysis - XGBoost ML Model</li>
</ol>

<h3>User Interface and APIs</h3>
<p>The use interface for the present version is a web application developed using ReactJS (VITE). The APIs are developed using FastAPI.</p>

<h3>Deployment</h3>
<p>Due to a lack of open source options, the deployment is tested in <b>Play with Docker</b></p>

<h4>Improvements in upcoming verions</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Connecting the models for better Farmer UX</li>
  <li>IoT Embeeding System</li>
  <li>Introducing CI/CD pipelines</li>
  <li>Mobile stand-by application</li>
  <li>Improvised UI</li>
  <li>LLM models for translation</li>
</ol>
